An Associated Press analysis of video images suggests that the train may have been traveling at twice the speed limit for that stretch of track.


Spain's government said two probes have been launched into the cause of Wednesday night's crash near this Christian festival city in northwest Spain. The interior ministry raised the death toll to 80 in what was Spain's deadliest train wreck in four decades, while 95 remained hospitalized, 36 in critical condition, among them four children.
